# Task: Productivity App
- This is a combination of various mini projects that we may or maynot have created while learning HTML, CSS and JS.
- Until today I have create the features for theme selection, setting username and setting banner image.
- I have also created the date and time feature which updates on its own.
- I have made use of localstorage for storing names, themes, etc.
- There were supposed to be 3 themes but I couldn't decide on the third which I will add later
